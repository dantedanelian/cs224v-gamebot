Dante Danelian (danelian@stanford.edu), Vardhan Agrawal (vardhanagrawal@stanford.edu)

The following files contain a Unity project which include a sample scene with our integrated
game tutor, GameBot. To use the tutor, open the project in Unity 2021.3 and navigate to
Assets > Creator Kit - RPG > Scenes > SampleScene.unity.

Hit the play button at the top of the screen to run the scene, and navigate using the arrow keys.
In the bottom right-hand corner, there is a blue button which toggles the GameBot interface, which
you can type queries directly into.
